# Code Test MB2
Here is the project for the MB2 course Introduction to Programming and Geostatistics

Through this script an easy and fast way is proposed to observe the decrease over time of the water level of the Acualeo Lagoon in Chile. It is also possible to modify this code to observe other gaps in the world, using the data provided by https://www.sdg661.app/data-products/data-downloads and a shape (georeferenced) delimiting the area.

This script was made for testing purposes and can be used and modified in the future by those who deem it convenient.
